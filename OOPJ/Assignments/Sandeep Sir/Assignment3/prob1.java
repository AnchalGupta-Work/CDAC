/*
 * . Loan Amortization Calculator
Implement a system to calculate and display the monthly payments for a mortgage loan. The system should:
1.	Accept the principal amount (loan amount), annual interest rate, and loan term (in years) from the user.
2.	Calculate the monthly payment using the standard mortgage formula:
o	Monthly Payment Calculation:
	monthlyPayment = principal * (monthlyInterestRate * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^(numberOfMonths)) / ((1 + monthlyInterestRate)^(numberOfMonths) - 1)
	Where monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate / 12 / 100 and numberOfMonths = loanTerm * 12
	Note: Here ^ means power and to find it you can use Math.pow( ) method
3.	Display the monthly payment and the total amount paid over the life of the loan, in Indian Rupees (₹).
Define class LoanAmortizationCalculator with methods acceptRecord, calculateMonthlyPayment & printRecord and test the functionality in main method.
